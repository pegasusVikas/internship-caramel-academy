To run the site on localhost, we need to install the required dependencies first for the client and the server.
Run the following commands from the root directory to install the dependencies:
1. cd Server
2. npm install
3. cd..
4. cd web
5. npm install

To start the app, open the terminal in the Server directory and run the command: 
node app.js
This will start the backend server and establish a connection with the mongodb cluster.
Then, in the web directory, open the terminal and run the command:
npm run start
This will start the react app and will open it up on your browser automatically.
